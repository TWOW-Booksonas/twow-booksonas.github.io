This GitHub Pages serves as, effectively, a Content Delivery Network specifically for TWOW booksonas. 

In order to upload your own book, you can use the __p!booksona__ command on PepsiBot, which is my TWOW community Discord bot. 

All of the folders in this repository are named by Discord user IDs, with each folder having the corresponding user's books. All of them have a **default.png**, and may have additional files if that user chose to upload multiple booksonas.

meta.tsv contains metadata of the repository, as well as usernames and display names for the Discord accounts of all the users of the database.
